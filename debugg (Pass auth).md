# Project Progress Report: URL Shortener Microservice

## Overview
The URL Shortener microservice is designed to provide a simple, modular, and efficient way to shorten URLs. The project follows a structured implementation roadmap, focusing on core features, analytics, and performance optimizations.

## Implementations and Features

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Basic Infrastructure
- **Initial Project Structure**: Set up project directory, initialized Git repository, created README.md, and configured the development environment.
- **Database Setup**: Created PostgreSQL schema for URLs and clicks, configured Redis for caching, and established database connection utilities.
- **Basic API Framework**: Implemented a basic server structure with a health check endpoint and configured middleware for logging and error handling.

### Phase 2: Core URL Shortening Features
- **URL Shortening Service**: Implemented URL validation, short ID generation, URL storage in PostgreSQL, and Redis caching.
- **URL Redirection**: Created a redirection endpoint with a cache-first lookup strategy and basic error handling.
- **Basic Testing**: Wrote unit tests for URL shortening and redirection, and tested cache integration.

### Phase 3: Analytics Foundation
- **Click Tracking**: Implemented click recording service, created database schema for analytics, and added basic click counting.
- **Basic Analytics**: Implemented simple analytics endpoints and created basic analytics queries.
- **Testing and Documentation**: Wrote tests for analytics and documented API endpoints.

### Phase 4: Enhanced Analytics and Performance
- **Geo-Location Integration**: Integrated MaxMind GeoLite2 for country tracking and basic geo-analytics.
- **Device Analytics**: Added user-agent parsing and device type detection.
- **Performance Optimization**: Implemented rate limiting, optimized database queries, and added performance monitoring.

### Phase 5: Finalization and Deployment
- **Docker Setup**: Created Dockerfile, set up docker-compose, and configured environment variables.
- **Documentation and Testing**: Completed API documentation, added integration tests, and created a deployment guide.
- **Final Review and Cleanup**: Conducted code review, performance testing, and security review.

## Current Problem: PostgreSQL Authentication Issue

### Issue Description
The server is currently failing to start due to a PostgreSQL authentication error. The error message indicates that the password authentication for the user "postgres" is failing:

```
FATAL: password authentication failed for user "postgres" (SQLSTATE 28P01)
```

### Troubleshooting Steps Taken
1. **Environment Variables**: Verified that the environment variables for PostgreSQL are set correctly:
   - `POSTGRES_HOST`: localhost
   - `POSTGRES_PORT`: 5432
   - `POSTGRES_USER`: postgres
   - `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: postgres
   - `POSTGRES_DB`: urlshortener

2. **Docker Container**: Recreated the PostgreSQL container from scratch to ensure a clean state. The container is running and accessible.

3. **PostgreSQL Configuration**: Modified the `pg_hba.conf` file to trust all connections, but the issue persists.

4. **Redis Connectivity**: Verified that Redis is running and accessible, but the server is not reaching that point due to the PostgreSQL error.

### Next Steps
- **Verify PostgreSQL Credentials**: Double-check the credentials in the PostgreSQL container and ensure they match the environment variables.
- **Check for Docker Volumes**: Ensure no old volumes are causing the issue.
- **Test Connection Manually**: Use a GUI or CLI tool to test the connection to PostgreSQL from the host machine.
- **Recreate the Container**: If necessary, recreate the PostgreSQL container with the correct configuration.

## Conclusion
The project is progressing well, with core features implemented and tested. The current focus is on resolving the PostgreSQL authentication issue to ensure the server can start successfully. Once this is resolved, the team can proceed with further testing and deployment. 

## Next Steps
- **Run the Application**: Use the command `go run main.go` to start the application.
- **Verify the Server**: Ensure the server is running and accessible.
- **Test the Application**: Use tools like `curl` or a browser to test the application's functionality.
- **Monitor the Logs**: Check the logs for any errors or warnings that might indicate issues with the server.

Let me know if you encounter any further errors or if the server starts successfully!
